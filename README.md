# Predicting a Calorie Burn and Creating Workout Program


## Motivation: 

When I first started working out, I struggled to understand how different exercises impacted my calorie burn. Most fitness apps and devices provided generic estimations that didnâ€™t take my body type, age, or workout intensity into account. This often left me uncertain about which workouts were most effective for my goals.

Through this project, I aim to explore a more data-driven and personalized approach to calorie burn estimation. By analyzing factors like workout duration, heart rate, body temperature, and body composition, I want to create a model that can provide more accurate calorie burn predictions. This will not only help me optimize my own workouts but also assist others in making informed decisions about their fitness routines.

By leveraging data analysis, we can move beyond traditional estimations and create a more scientific approach to fitness tracking.

## Data Source:

1. Kaggle dataset on exercise and calorie burn it includes different parameters like ages, heights, weights, exercise duration, heart rate and body temperature.
2. Personal data from the apple watch (apple health)

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Our exploratory data analysis revealed several important patterns in the fitness and calorie burn data:

### Correlation Analysis

The correlation matrix shows that:
- Duration (0.96), Heart Rate (0.90), and Body Temperature (0.82) have the strongest correlations with calorie burn
- Weight and Height have minimal direct correlation with calories burned
- BMI shows moderate correlation with Weight (0.70)

### Exercise Parameters and Calorie Burn

This visualization demonstrates the relationship between heart rate, workout duration, and calories burned:
- Higher heart rates combined with longer durations result in maximum calorie burn
- Even at lower heart rates, longer durations lead to significant calorie burn
- The pattern shows a clear positive trend where both factors contribute to increased calorie expenditure

### Variable Relationships with Calories

Key findings from the scatter plots:
- Duration shows the strongest linear relationship with calories burned
- Weight shows a moderate correlation with calorie burn
- User_ID has no relationship with calories, as expected
- Age shows a slight positive trend with calorie burn

### Distributions of Key Variables

The distributions reveal:
- Age is skewed toward younger participants
- Height and Weight follow normal distributions
- Duration shows several peaks, suggesting common workout durations
- Heart Rate shows a multimodal distribution with peaks around 90 and 100 bpm

### Demographic Analysis

![Calories by BMI Category](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BoraDemirkol/Bora-Demirkol-DSA-project/main/results/figures/Unknown-11.png)

Demographic findings:
- Gender appears to have minimal impact on calorie burn
- Older age groups (45+) tend to burn more calories on average
- Overweight individuals show slightly higher calorie burn compared to normal BMI
- Limited data for underweight and obese categories affects those comparisons

### Conclusions

1. Workout duration is the most significant predictor of calorie burn
2. Heart rate and body temperature are also strong predictors
3. Physical characteristics (height, weight) have limited direct impact on calories burned
4. Age shows a slight positive relationship with calorie burn
5. The data suggests that longer workouts at moderate-to-high heart rates are most effective for calorie burning


## Hypothesis Test Summary

We tested whether calorie burn efficiency (Calories/Minute) differs by BMI category using one-way ANOVA.

**Result**: Statistically significant difference found (p < 0.05).

## Feature Selection & Data Preprocessing:

Workout Type (Strength, Cardio, HIIT, etc.): Different types of workouts burn calories differently.

BMI (Body Mass Index): Provides insight into body composition.

Height and Weight: Used to calculate BMI and analyze the body composition. 

Age: Metabolism slows with age, impacting calorie burning. 

Workout Duration: Longer workouts generally burn more calories. 

Heart Rate: Higher heart rate indicates higher exertion levels.

Body Temperature: Higher temperatures might indicate more intense workouts.

## Machine Learning Models:

Since I have not covered machine learning in class yet, I plan to first complete the initial data analysis and gain a better understanding of the dataset. 

Once I learn the necessary machine learning techniques, I will implement them later in the project. 

Additionally, I plan to develop an interactive web-based tool using Gradio, which will allow users to input their workout details (e.g., duration, heart rate, body temperature) and receive a real-time estimated calorie burn prediction from the trained model.

This will help demonstrate the practical use of machine learning in fitness applications and allow for user feedback to improve the model further.

## Findings (Expected Outcomes):

## This project aims to answer the following key questions:

- Which exercise type burns the most calories on average?
  
- How do weight, age, and gender affect calorie burn?

- Can we develop a model that accurately predicts calorie burn based on workout data?
   
## Limitations:

- Measuring actual calorie burn requires laboratory-grade equipment.
  
- Personal data collection may have inaccuracies (e.g., fitness trackers may not be 100% accurate in calorie estimations).

## Future Work

- Include more exercise types, such as yoga, HIIT, and weight training.
  
- Improve accuracy by integrating heart rate and oxygen consumption (VO2 max) data.
  
- Develop a real-time prediction system as a mobile or web application.

In conclusion, this project aims to provide a more accurate and personalized approach to estimating calorie burn, helping individuals optimize their workout plans. */
