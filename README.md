/* Calorie Burn Prediction Based on Exercise Types

## Motivation: 

Accurately estimating calorie expenditure during exercise can help individuals optimize their workout plans and achieve their fitness goals. However, most fitness applications and devices use generalized calorie estimation formulas rather than personalized predictions. This project aims to develop a machine learning-based model that can provide more accurate calorie burn predictions based on different exercise types.

I personally work out four times a week, and when I first started training, I struggled to find the right program for myself. Most workout plans and fitness applications provide generic calorie burn estimations without considering individual factors such as weight, age, gender, or workout intensity. Because of this, I often found myself uncertain about which exercises were the most efficient for my specific goals.

This project is motivated by my own experience of trying to optimize my workouts and help others personalize their exercise routines by providing data-driven calorie burn predictions. The goal is to analyze how factors such as age, weight, gender, workout duration, and exercise type influence calorie burn and build a model that can offer customized insights for users.
Data Source:

The dataset for this project will come from multiple sources:

Public Datasets:
Kaggle datasets on exercise and calorie burn (e.g., MET-based calculations)
CDC & WHO physical activity guidelines
University research databases: Open datasets related to exercise and metabolism
Personal Data:
Data collected using Apple Health, Google Fit, or fitness trackers
Manual tracking of exercise type, duration, and heart rate
Additional Supporting Data:
Open datasets on BMI, age, gender, and their impact on exercise efficiency
Research papers on nutrition and exercise performance
Data Analysis
The project will involve data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning techniques to analyze and predict calorie burn.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Average calorie burn for different exercise types
The impact of age, weight, and gender on calorie burn
Ranking exercises based on their MET (Metabolic Equivalent of Task) values
Feature Selection & Data Preprocessing:
Cleaning missing or inconsistent data
Selecting meaningful features (weight, age, workout duration, heart rate)
Normalization and scaling
Machine Learning Models:
Linear Regression: A simple predictive model
Random Forest: A more complex, high-accuracy model
Model performance will be evaluated using RMSE, MAE, and other error metrics
Findings (Expected Outcomes):
This project aims to answer the following key questions:
- Which exercise type burns the most calories on average?
- How do weight, age, and gender affect calorie burn?
- Is there a linear relationship between workout duration and calorie burn, or does it plateau after a certain point?
- Can machine learning models provide more accurate, personalized calorie burn predictions compared to traditional methods?

Limitations and Future Work

Limitations:
- Since the dataset comes from different sources, there may be data inconsistencies.
- Measuring actual calorie burn requires laboratory-grade equipment.
- Personal data collection may have inaccuracies (e.g., fitness trackers may not be 100% accurate in calorie estimations).

Future Work
- Include more exercise types, such as yoga, HIIT, and weight training.
- Improve accuracy by integrating heart rate and oxygen consumption (VO2 max) data.
- Develop a real-time prediction system as a mobile or web application.

In conclusion, this project aims to provide a more accurate and personalized approach to estimating calorie burn, helping individuals optimize their workout plans. */
